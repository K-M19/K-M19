Hello👋

**Hi!, I'm ButAa!**
  - Or can called **K-M19**, I am a Software Engineer.

Don't expect anything too exciting or public here Xdd — most of my projects are private or shared in closed circles.
But sometimes I do release open-source or closed-source projects, and share some fun tools too!

And every now and then, I also join both small and big projects — quietly helping out behind the scenes, like a shadow in a hoodie. :shipit:

Here is my LICENSE and terms you should read it before using or exploring my archive: [LICENSE](https://github.com/K-M19/CUSTOM-LICENSE/blob/main/README.md)
